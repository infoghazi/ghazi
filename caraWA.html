Creating stickers for WhatsApp
If you'd like to create your own stickers for WhatsApp, you can package them in an Android or iOS app. You can publish your sticker app like any other app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, and users who download and install your app will be able to start sending those stickers right away from within WhatsApp. Stickers on WhatsApp must be legal, authorized and acceptable. Learn more about acceptable uses of our services from our Terms of Service.

We've provided sample apps and code for both Android and iOS that provide a simple way for you to drop in your sticker art and build an app with only minimal development or coding experience needed. Advanced developers can also make richer sticker apps using the set of APIs and interfaces that WhatsApp supports. Please read the requirements below for designing your own stickers and refer to the README files associated with the sample apps for the complete set of requirements and tips you'll need to create your sticker apps.

To create your own sticker art, your stickers must meet the following requirements:

Each sticker is an image that has a transparent background.
Stickers must be exactly 512x512 pixels.
Each sticker must be less than 100 KB. See the README files associated with the sample apps for tips on reducing the file size of your stickers.
You must also provide an icon that will be used to represent your sticker pack in the WhatsApp sticker picker or tray. This image should be 96x96 pixels and must be less than 50 KB. See the README files associated with the sample apps for tips on reducing the file size of your tray icon.

In addition to the requirements above, we strongly recommend the following when designing your stickers:

Stickers will render on a variety of backgrounds, including white, black, colored and patterned. For this reason, we recommend you add an 8-pixel #FFFFFF stroke to the outside of each sticker.
There should be a 16-pixel margin between the actual sticker image and the edge of the 512x512 pixel canvas.
